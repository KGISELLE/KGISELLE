### Hi, I'm Giselle, a student of Frond-end Development 

I love my name because it's a princess name, isn't it? I'm kidding, my name comes from a famous ballet performance, so that I love the fantasy world. I love animation and videogames world!!! ðŸ‘‹

I'm studying Frond-end Develoment, at the moment I love CSS and design softwares.
