## Hi, I'm Giselle, Software Developer!!! 👩‍💻 <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/mGcNjsfWAjY5AEZNw6/giphy.gif" width="50">

💫 I love my name — not because it sounds like a princess (just kidding!) but because it comes from a famous ballet performance. That’s probably why I’m drawn to everything artistic.

🎮 I’m passionate about animation and video games.

🎨 I also love CSS and design tools, which inspired me to study Frontend Development. 

👩‍🎨 For me, coding is like bringing ideas to life with my own hands.
